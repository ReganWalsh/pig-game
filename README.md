# *Pig*
Based On [Pig Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)). Is a two-player dice game where during Each turn, a player rolls two dice until either player has rolled a 1 or the player decides to "hold" their current accrued points.
* If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
* If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
* If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
